## Project Overview

The Round Robin (RR) scheduling algorithm assigns each ready process a fixed time quantum. Selecting this quantum arbitrarily can lead either to excessive context switching (if too small) or FCFS‑like behavior (if too large), degrading performance. This project applies both regression and classification machine learning techniques to predict an optimal time quantum—minimizing average waiting time across randomized process schedules.

## Features

- **Automated Schedule Generation**  
  Randomly generates process sets (15–20 processes) with burst times and arrival times.  
- **Data Engineering Pipeline**  
  Extracts relevant features: min/max/average burst and arrival times, number of processes, total completion time, and optimal quantum.  
- **Regression Analysis**  
  Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Polynomial, Bayesian Ridge, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, and ANN models to predict continuous quantum values.  
- **Classification Analysis**  
  K‑Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest Classifier to predict discrete quantum classes (5–15).  
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**  
  Metrics include MAE, MSE, R² for regression; accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score for classification.  
- **Reproducible Framework**  
  Well‑structured scripts and notebooks to regenerate data, train models, and reproduce figures (heatmaps, feature importances, classification reports).

## Data Generation & Description

The dataset is synthetically generated by creating multiple RR schedules with:

- **Number of Processes:** Random integer between 15 and 20  
- **Burst Times:** Random integer between *x* and *x + 5*, where *x* ∈ [0, 10]  
- **Arrival Times:** Random integer between 0 and 10  
- **Time Quantum Trials:** RR applied with quantum values from 5 to 15 to find the value minimizing average waiting time  

Extracted features per schedule include the optimal time quantum, statistics of arrival/burst times (min, max, average), number of processes, and total completion time.

## Methodology

### Data Engineering

1. **Random Schedule Creation**  
   Generate process parameters (arrival and burst times).  
2. **RR Scheduling Simulation**  
   Compute average waiting time for each candidate quantum.  
3. **Feature Extraction**  
   Collate statistical descriptors and identify the optimal quantum for each schedule.

### Regression Models

Continuous prediction of time quantum using multiple approaches:

- Linear Regression  
- Ridge and Lasso Regression  
- Polynomial Regression  
- Bayesian Ridge Regression  
- Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)  
- Gradient Boost Regression  
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

Evaluation metrics:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- R‑Squared (R²)

### Classification Models

Discrete classification of quantum values (5–15) using:

- K‑Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Random Forest Classifier

Evaluation metrics:
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1 Score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Feature Importances

## Results

- **Best Regression:** Polynomial Regression and Bayesian Ridge achieved R² ≈ 0.84 and MAE ≈ 0.215.  
- **Best Classification:** Random Forest Classifier achieved test accuracy ≈ 89.2 %.

## Conclusion & Future Work

Framing time‑quantum prediction as a classification task yields robust, integer‑valued outputs—avoiding fractional or overly large quantum values that degrade RR performance. Future directions include:

- Incorporating real-world scheduling traces  
- Deploying an interactive API or CLI tool for dynamic quantum recommendation  
- Extending to multi‑core or cloud scheduling environments
